My name is Kevin Grant Jr. and I am up and coming author with aspirations of writing my first novel and sharing it with the world. Along the way, I plan to post my wins, hardships, and everything I learn in-between.

Hopefully, this site will one day turn in to a hub where I can share my many novels, ideas, and creations with all the beautiful people who have come to enjoy my work! That, or I am destined to fail. Time will tell, right?
